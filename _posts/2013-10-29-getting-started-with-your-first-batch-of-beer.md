title: Getting Started With Your First Batch of Beer!
---

A lot of people are intimidated by home brewing beer.  Most think it is too hard, you have to have a lot of fancy equipment, or it's just plain illegal.  In reality, none of these are true, and home brewing your own beer is a very fun and rewarding experience.

When I first heard a friend say he brewed his own beer, I decided I would do some research.  After a quick Google search, I was extremely overwhelmed!  The numerous methods and terms were really intimidating and didn't make any sense.  I didn't know what to do.

After a slight bit of discouragement, I decided I would contact my friend and ask him how to get started.  He reccommended [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Homebrewing-Third-Edition/dp/0060531053) book.  After reading the book, I was hooked.

The book does a very nice job of explaining the different ingrdients and equipment, while also taking you through the brewing process.  It starts with a very simple extract brew and progresses to an all-grain brew with added ingredients of your choice.  I highly reccommend the book for anyone interested in learning to home brew their own beer.

So after my little tangent, back to breaking the fallacies of home brewing.

### Is it hard?

Not at all.  Creating your first beer couldn't be easier or more delicious.  There are numerous resources to help you with the termonology.  There are also plenty of ready-to-brew kits, that come with all the ingredients you need to brew beer.  If you are interested in purchasing a kit, [HomeBrewster](http://homebrewster.com) offers a service that sends a monthly all-grain beer kit right to your door.

The process of brewing beer can be condensed down into very basic step.  Essentially, the process consists of creating flavor sugar water, boiling that water, adding yeast, and letting the yeast turn the sugar in the water into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  See that wasn't so hard!

### Do I need a lot of fance equipment?

All you need is a big 4 to 6 gallon (depending on how much you are brewing) pot to brew water in, an air tight container to ferment in, a thermometer, and a hydrometer.  With this equipment, you should be able to make your first batch of beer.  Of course other you are going to need bottles, but those can be obtained from your local bar or home brewing store.

### Is it illegal?

Definitely not!  Making your own beer, or any alcohol for that matter, isn't at all illegal.  The illegal part is distributing and/or selling to other people.  To distribute you need licensing and you have to run your beer through a much more strenuous brewing process to pass regulations.  So the bottom line is, as long as you are keeping your brew to yourself, you are not breaking the law.  Why would you wanna share anyways? ;)


### Wrapping it up.

Don't be discouraged by first impressions!  Home brewing your own beer is easy and delicious.

Next steps would be to buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Homebrewing-Third-Edition/dp/0060531053) book and start brewing.  I highly reccommend it, and it will teach you the basics of brewing your own beer.
