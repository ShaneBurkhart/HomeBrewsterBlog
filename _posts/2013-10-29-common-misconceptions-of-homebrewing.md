title: Common Misconceptions of Homebrewing.
---

A lot of people are intimidated by homebrewing beer.  Most think that it's too hard or that you need a lot of fancy equipment.  Some people think it's just plain illegal.  In reality, these are all myths.  Brewing your own beer is a very fun and rewarding experience.

When I first heard a friend say he brewed his own beer, I decided to do some research.  After a quick Google search, I was extremely overwhelmed!  The numerous methods and terms were really intimidating and didn't make any sense.  I had no idea what to do.

After some slight discouragement, I decided I would contact my friend and ask him how to get started.  He recommended [The Complete Joy of Homebrewing](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Homebrewing-Third-Edition/dp/0060531053).  After a quick read, I was hooked.

The book does a very nice job of explaining the different ingredients and equipment while taking you through the brewing process.  It starts with a very simple extract brew and eventually progresses to an all-grain brew with added ingredients of your choice.  I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in learning to brew their own beer.

Anyways, let's get back to breaking the fallacies of homebrewing.

### Is it hard?

Not at all.  Creating your first beer couldn't be easier, and the results couldn't be more delicious.  There are numerous resources to help you with the terminology.  There are also plenty of ready-to-brew kits that come with all the ingredients you need to brew beer.  If you're interested in purchasing a kit, [HomeBrewster](http://homebrewster.com) offers a service that sends a monthly all-grain beer kit right to your door.

The process of brewing beer can be condensed down into very basic steps.  Essentially, the process consists of creating flavored sugar water, boiling that water, adding yeast, and letting the yeast turn the sugar in the water into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  See!  That wasn't so hard!

### Do I need a lot of fancy equipment?

All you need is a big 4 to 6 gallon (depending on how much you are brewing) pot for boiling water, an airtight container for fermenting, a thermometer, and a hydrometer.  With this equipment, you should be able to make your first batch of beer.  Of course, you're going to need bottles, but those can be obtained from your local bar or homebrewing store.

### Is it illegal?

Definitely not!  Making your own beer, or any alcohol for that matter, isn't at all illegal.  The illegal part is distributing and/or selling to other people.  In order to distribute, you need licensing and you have to run your beer through a much more strenuous brewing process to pass regulations.  The bottom line: As long as you keep your brew to yourself, you aren't breaking the law.  Why would you wanna share anyways? ;)


### Wrapping it up.

Don't be discouraged by first impressions!  Homebrewing your own beer is easy and delicious.

Next steps would be to buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Homebrewing-Third-Edition/dp/0060531053) book and start brewing.  I highly recommend it, and it will teach you the basics of brewing your own beer.
