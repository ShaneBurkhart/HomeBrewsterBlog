title: Why Are My Bottles Exploding? Beer Bombs.
---

It's a homebrewer's nightmare.  Your bottles are exploding, and your precious brew is being wasted!  When this happens, there isn't much you can do except take all of the caps off and recap (relieves the pressure in the bottles).  Having said that, there are steps that can be taken to prevent these exploding beer bombs.

### What causes beer bombs?

As you might expect, beer bombs are the result of the pressure in your bottles getting to such a point where they explode.  The yeast is producing extra carbon dioxide because there is too much sugar in the beer.  We can easily prevent this problem with a few simple steps.

### Be patient!!!

I know you are anxious to drink your beer, but bottling early is a sure way to cause explosions.  This is because when you bottle early, the yeast isn't done converting the sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  Because of this, the yeast will continue fermenting after bottling, and produce excess pressure.  To ensure the yeast is done, use a hydrometer.

### Hydrometer is your friend.

Hydrometers are used to read specific gravity or density of liquid.  We can take readings over multiple days to see if the density of sugar in the beer has changed.  Once it has stopped changing for three days, fermenting is done.  At this point, your beer is ready for bottling.

### No foam does not mean fermenting is done!

It's natural to get excited when your beer stops foaming, but this alone does not mean your beer is ready.  The yeast could be temporarily dormant and may start again.  To ensure that the beer is done fermenting, you MUST take hydrometer readings.  There is no other way to be completely sure your beer is done.

### Don't over prime your bottles.

Lastly, a sure way to create beer bombs is to add too much sugar to the beer before bottling.  For a 5 gallon batch, you only need 2/3 cup of cane sugar or 3/4 cup of corn sugar.  Simply add this to 2 cups of boiling water, let it cool, and add to beer just before bottling.  Anymore than that and you will most likely have exploding bottles.

### Wrapping it up.

Beer bombs are easy to prevent, you just need to be patient.  Don't let the excitement get to you.  Use a hydrometer to make sure the gravity hasn't changed for 3 days.  This will ensure your beer is done fermenting.  Also, make sure you don't add too much priming sugar to your bottles.  Following these step will almost ensure you don't waste your delicious beer.  Happy brewing!
