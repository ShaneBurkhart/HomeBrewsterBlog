Today, we have officially launched the site and are now accepting payments.  We are very excited and hope you are too!  The first brew kits will be shipped Monday, November ____.  All payments submitted by the previous Friday will be sent their first home brewing kit.

Initially, we are offering the option of either all grain or extract kits in three, five, or ten gallon sizes.
