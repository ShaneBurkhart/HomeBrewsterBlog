title: How To Brew Small Batches of Beer.
---

Whether it's the lack of space, equipment, or you just want to try many different kinds of beer, many people, including me, want to brew small batches of beer.  Having said that, there aren't very may good articles explaining how to do it.  Therefore, I am writing this article to hopefully add a useful resource.

This article will focus on extract recipes with an added specialty grain bag.

### How small are we talking?

When I say small batches of beer, I am referring to anything less than 3 gallons.  In particular, I am going to focus on around 1 gallon batches.  I like this size because it can be easily done in almost any environment, and allows me to try a lot of different styles of beer.

### What do I need?

The process is essentially the same. The only difference is it is scalled down.  You most likely have a lot the equipment already:
- A pot that can hold 2 - 3 gallons of water.  Your spaghetti pot will work.
- 2 one gallon jugs.
